<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a husband and father of 3, have been married exactly 20 years now. I can honestly say I am very fortunate and blessed for a family of my own. They are my world for the last the 2 decades, I feel a sense of achievement because of them being in my life.</p> 
<p>Ever since childhood I was obsessed and fascinated with computers and games. My fascination took off in the teens when internet became available, I was on chat sites, surfing websites, watching videos. I then began to play around with Windows device manager, control panels, display settings. I then disassembled laptops and PCs to upgrade hard drive, rams, graphics card. The nonstop learning just kept me engaged with anything computer, later I was fascinated with software programming and database. I decided to begin a journey of learning how to build webs apps, took up various bootcamp courses for Web Development and SQL for database manipulation. </p> 
<p>As I had the great responsibility of providing for family, I simply had to be in employment and couldnâ€™t accommodate any time for academic progress. My employment has been mostly in customer facing roles, which gave me a lot of experience and deep understanding of people skills. Now that my children have grown into their teens themselves, I seem to have a newfound freedom, which enabled me to get back into studying computer programming.</p>
<p>As a Web Developer I hope to improve my work life, I want to develop useful technologies with styles and make it interactive. This is the side of me I wish to turn into reality and as a professional career.</p>
